This file is lacking. I don't know to what point you want to test peoples. It should at least be included in the junior part (so maybe do a separated project for senior)

It should at the very least contain the instructions you sent me by mail, a short description of what is expected and what should not be done.

I dropped the last few tests as i was "blocked" by the tests. I'll do another one if needed.
